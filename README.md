# VDiary
This project is basically an android application.
The app is aimed at automating the Vit university's student login to get the attendance and class occurance for each student once they are logged in.
Features such as faculty tracking and custom to-do are implemented.
Also students will be notified 5 minutes before each class on their schedule.
